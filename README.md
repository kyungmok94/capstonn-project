# Sparkify-Capstone Project
This is the Capstone project. It was built using pyspark as part of this one deviance prediction system.

**Project Overview** \
This project will use PySpark to predict whether an online music streaming company will unsubscribe.
It's called Sparky Pie. This is a classification issue, as you can predict whether the customer will be swayed or not. Everything's painful here.
It is currently being used in a variety of areas, including IT, healthcare, and infrastructure.

**Project Motivation** \
Machine learning is very important for different organizations to understand messages related to them and messages to prioritize. Deviation prediction is a challenging and common problem that data scientists and analysts regularly face in every enterprise facing their customers. In addition, the ability to efficiently manipulate large datasets using sparks is one of the most demanding technologies in the data field. The entire dataset is 12GB, of which 123MB of mini-subset was analyzed. We will use PySpark extensively to solve this problem.

**Step** \
Load large data sets into the spark and manipulate data using spark SQL and spark data frames.
Builds and coordinates models using machine learning APIs within Spark ML.

**STRUCTURE**\
The following folders exist in the repository:
>*1. Sparkify.ipynb* - Includes analysis and detailed coding of the project.\
>*2. readme.md* - Readme file.

**Pre-requisites** \
  Following packages should be installed in the system before running the notebook.
  >SparkContext
  >pyspark\
  >pyspark.sql.SparkSession\
  >pyspark.sql\
  >datetime\
